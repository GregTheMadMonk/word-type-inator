_Oh! Player the human! How unexpected, and by that I mean... COMPLETELY UNEXPECTED!_
# word-type-inator
A simple word typing game for Node.js

An up-to-date version of the game is playable at: https://gregthemadmonk-word-type-inator.glitch.me/

No levels to play? Feel free to create one!

_According to all known laws of common sense, there is no way this game should be able to function. <...> The game, of course, runs anyway, because games don't care what humans think is impossible._
## This is my first Node.js project!

So, please, put your beating-to-death stone in the bing near the entrance. When leaving, they will be returned to you safe and sound.

## Feedback and contribution are greatly appreciated
Jokes aside, I really believe I can make this game the best it could possibly be. Or at least a simple good game. Anyway, if you have any ideas you want to share - DO IT!
